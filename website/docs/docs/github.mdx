The github sync binary runs one cycle and then exits.
For automatical sync schedule executions of the module with cron or similar.

## Single Execution

Each cycle consists of two parts: Incoming and Outgoing.
The incoming phase only syncs data from github to gropius while the outgoing phase syncs only from gropius to github.

### Incoming

During the Incoming phase the sync first downloads all new events from github.
These events are immediately added to the MongoDB and the timestamps for the github api moved to avoid repeated downloads.

After everything has been downloaded, the missing issues are created and all timeline items inserted into the timelines.

### Outgoing

The outgoing phase collects all new issues and timeline items that have no known github id and have not been invalidated (e.g. no reopen after close event).
These differences are then collected and prepared for submission to github.

After all mutations are collected, a final damage control check ensures that the amount of mutations does not exceed a threshold to prevent damage to larger public repositories in case of issues with the sync.
Then all of the mutations are executed and the ids of the created issues and timeline items added to the MongoDB.
