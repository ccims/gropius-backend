# Modules

## Runnable Modules

### api-public

The main GraphQL API of the backend.
Can safely be publicly exposed and can be horizontally scaled. 
By default, users have to be authenticated. A JWT must be obtained via the authentication service (tbd) and then provided with each GraphQL request using the Authorization-Header:
```
Authorization: Bearer token
```
Authorization can be disabled for debugging purposes by setting `gropius.api.debugNoAuthentication=true`, however, note that mutations still require the token to determine the user (however permissions will not be checked).  
Depends on [api-common](#api-common)

#### Configuration Properties
|Name|Default value|Description|
|--|--|--|
|gropius.api.public.debugNoAuthentication|`false`|If `true`, authorization is disabled|
|gropius.api.public.jwtSecret|- (required)|Secret for JWT validation|

### api-internal

The internal GraphQL API of the backend.
MUST NOT be publicly exposed as no authentication or authorization is done.
Can be horizontally scaled.
If the `gropius.api.internal.apiToken` config property is set, users have to be authenticated using the Authorization-Header:
```
Authorization: Bearer token
```
Depends on [api-common](#api-common)

#### Configuration Properties
|Name|Default value|Description|
|--|--|--|
|gropius.api.internal.apiToken||If provided, each GraphQL request must provide the token in the Authorization header|

### github

Github sync that executes exactly one sync cycle.
May not be executed more than once at the same time.
Documentation about the concept can be found [here](github.mdx).  
Depends on [sync](#sync)

## Abstract Modules

### core

The core part of the Gropius backend, contains the domain model as well as service and repository classes.  
Requires a Neo4j database, for the configuration see [Configure the project](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/#configure-spring-boot-project).

### api-common

Contains common functionality for [api-public](#api-public) and [api-internal](#api-internal).  
By default, the API is provided on port 8080 at the endpoint `/graphql`, a GraphQL Playground can be found at `/playground`. 
For the configuration of the GraphQL endpoints, see [Configuration Properties](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/server/spring-server/spring-properties).  
Depends on [core](#core)

### sync

Contains abstract helpers for general sync development.
